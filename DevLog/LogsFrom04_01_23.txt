// added functionality to the bullets by adding collision detection
// when they hit an enemy they dissapear
// every round the stakeholder goes up by the health increases by 20 points

// stuff in assets now have a full working code for thiis game all ii need  nowto document it and see what i can add
// use a button as a start screen with a fat start and a died screen 
// next you can see to add some art or animations


04/01/2023 7:17am 
// Game points 
// just added some stuff in the state class 
// unextended the class to the game class 
// made a menu object so i can have easy acsses to it in the state class.


04/01/2023 10:22 am 
// watch cs50 flask video to learn how to intergrate a back end into my website


04/01/2023 11:40pm
// my program is now a half stack 
// i used flask to do this
// so all i need to do is add some scores and add them to a database and output them 


05/01/2023  1am
// i can try to adjust the game so that if it detects its on a mobile it can use an alternative set of event listeners instead of the defult ones


07/01/2023 19:40
// i have added fucntionality for the score to update and render
// i did this by adding a Draw score method in the player class
// then increasing the score when you hit an enemy by 1 (in the renderbullets method in the game class)
// for now the probability to hit a enemy is about 70%
// added the drawing and functonality to show the round too in the game class


08/01/2023 2am
// i have added a functionality for when the player dies stakeholders can now choose to play again 
// this is new and does not use the state class and instead there is a method for cecking if the stakeholder has chosen to play again in the game, it resets all the stats too.
// next step: PAUSING


08/01/2023 10:47 am
// pausing is now functional
// i just added some attributes to the menu object then i used the same logic that i used for the died button
// now i could try to add some server-side processing programing.
// but first i need to finish the stakeholder menu


08/01/2023 4:24 pm
// improvments: i have made the main menu annd now i can move on to server- side processing which i which i will try to implement using sql and flask
// the main menu uses the menu object to render by using the menu_render() method 


08/01/2023 7:39 pm
// for some reason i am trying to add another button for the player to have the option of exiting the game but its not working need to fix that


08/01/2023 10pm
// i could try to load a html button file at the start of the game and for puased and died screen instead of doing collition dectection and use a class in the css file to make it easier than using buttons in javascript.


09/01/2023 1:11 am
// to make the menu / pause / died screens use react and somehow use it instead of html
// somehow try to connect react to python flask server and then that server connected to a sql database for highscores!
// sql db <--> flask <--> react 
// key words------: flask, react, bootstrap, typescript, angular, 


09/01/2023 11:11 am
// im currently trying to fix the click bug 
// if i click on the screen the click stays true and when i hover over any option it thinks its being clicked:
// need to fix this now


13/01/2023 2:23 am
// i could use react to show three diffrent canvases at 3 diffrent points in time depending on the user and what they press. i can use an onclick thing 


14:44
// i downloaded react and now i have to see how to use it.


20/01/2023
// react didnt work had to switch back to the usual javascript and HTML
// yesturday i added the collition detection between the player and the platforms. 
// added to the entity class
// today i added a random amount of speeds for the enemies.


23/01/2023  22:23
// i could use the matter game engine but i already have a cool working game and it would be wasteful to not use my own implementation.
// today i imrpoved the collition detection and now the game is in the middle.
// next steps : 
    1. fix the menu pages
    2. document it
    3. start backend processing

1.//// find a way to stop the click button bug.
2.//// find a way to stop the flickering in the game.
3.//// make a pause button for the top right corner of the canvas.


23/01/2023 
// the error only happens when the bullets are shot and the player is moving aswell as hitting the enemies.
// how can i fix it?
// could check for click before the next frame


27/01/2023
// think about using AXIOS. for http requests for backend maybe
// idea: could change the cliked attribute to a number but for now keep it the same


31/01/2023
// step 1: made file with class to send data;
// step 2: made that file connect to html file so that it is known in that file.
// made a requests counter attribute for Game class 
// step 3: when player dies make GameData object to send to the server.
// how can i make the javascript file send data back to the server?


03/02/2023
// trying to use axios to get past the error that shows up because its a promise or something:
// trying to connect axios to javascript but so far i have move the json files to the classes folder and still not working.so idk whats going on.
// added some scripts at the end of the html file but it doesnt work

05/02/2023
// axios worked now i have to make it so that it only sends back one data packet every time the player dies. ===>>> make a flowchart for it?


10/02/2023
// i managed to make some adjustments to the program
// i could add to a csv file and not a db file.


12/02/23 2am
// i managedd to get rid of any errors and now i have a code that works and sends data to the database but doesnt find all the data in it.
// perhaps use sqlalchmeny instead?

//later that day...
// i can try to read off the csv file and input the data into the database that way.


19/02/2023
// anyways today i have added so many improvements 
// the HTML, the high scores from the database
// the css
// some of the javascript,
// i just need to pre test it and make a function for when the score is bigger than the high score to change the element on the highscore.// 26/10/2024
